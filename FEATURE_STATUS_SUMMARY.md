- Enhanced Payment Integration (auto-renewal, reminders, multiple methods)
- Banking Bulk Payment & Reconciliation
- Demo Booking System
- Free Trial System

**Priority 2 (Critical for Operations):**
- Compliance Calendar
- NHF Calculator

**Priority 4 (Nice to Have):**

Would you like me to:
1. Implement all features systematically (will take multiple iterations)
2. Focus on Priority 1 features first
3. Create implementation files for all missing features with placeholders

Let me know your preference!
